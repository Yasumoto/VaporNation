# Week 5

## News

### Swift NIO
This week, Apple released [Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) at the try! Swift Confrence in Tokyo. Apple describes NIO as "a cross-platform asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients." For all you droplets that have been following Vapor 3 development, that means NIO will be replacing a significant portion of the code supporting Vapor behind the scenes. To quote [Tanner](https://github.com/tanner0101),

> Swift NIO directly replaces:
> - vapor/async (except we will keep our conveniences here, since they are nicer IMO)
> - vapor/sockets (we only supported TCP, they support TCP, UDP, Unix, way better!)
> - vapor/tls (finally, :pray:)
> - vapor/engine (except websockets and our multipart/form-url stuff. we will also port over our conveniences for header names, body, etc)

Vapor is going to take a performance hit until NIO's HTTP parser can be optimised, but the long term benifits greatly outweigh the short term drawbacks. Having a dedicated team at Apple working on all of the low level code means that the Vapor team is free to make large userfacing improvments using time previously spent mucking around with all the libraries that are being deprecated! 

This raises the question as to weather or not Vapor Nation should cover updates to NIO. What do you think? Drop your opinion in #vapor-nation on Slack or @VaporNationNews on Twitter!

### Swift By Sundell Featuring Tanner
[Swift By Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/) is a Swift podcast hosted by [@JohnSundell](https://github.com/JohnSundell) and this week's guest is [@tanner0101](https://github.com/tanner0101), founder of Vapor. John is accepting questions right now, so get them in soon!

## New Features

### RSA Encription Implemented and Made Available To JWT
```swift
// create public and private key (only public required for verification)
let privateKey: Data = ...
let publicKey: Data = ...
let privateSigner = JWTSigner.rs256(key: .private2048(privateKey))
let publicSigner = JWTSigner.rs256(key: .public2048(publicKey))

// serialize jwt (requires private key)
let payload: TestPayload = ...
var jwt = JWT(payload: payload)
_ = try jwt.sign(using: publicSigner) // throws, can't sign w/ public signer
let data = try jwt.sign(using: privateSigner)

// parse jwt (public and private key work)
let parsed = try JWT<TestPayload>(from: data, verifiedUsing: publicSigner)
let parsed2 = try JWT<TestPayload>(from: data, verifiedUsing: privateSigner) // also works
print(parsed.payload)
print(parsed2.payload)
```

## Microtutorial
HTTP requests have held the Internet together for tens of years, but they do have limitations. Some of those limitations are going to be addressed by [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2), but not quite all. One of those limitations is that the only way for a server to send data to a client is for the client to first send a request. It makes sense to have this limitation in place, I'd hate to be getting spammed by random servers all day, but that does mean that it's difficult for a server to send data to a client on it's own time. That means if you want to run a server for something like an instant messaging chat, the client is required to continuously poll the server, checking for new messages, otherwise it risks missing one. 

[Websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) solve this problem by opening an HTTP connection and leaving it open, thereby allowing the server and client to exchange information as needed, which is great if you're trying to set up a realtime application. The best news of all, Vapor supports them out of the box!

```swift
router.websocket("echo") { (req, ws) in
    ws.onString({ (ws, msg) in
        ws.send(string: msg)
    })
}
```

sets up a websocket route to `ws://localhost:8080/echo` and any data sent to that connection will sent right back.
