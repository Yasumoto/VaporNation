# Week 5

## News

### Swift NIO
This week, Apple released [Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) at the try! Swift Confrence in Tokyo. Apple describes NIO as "a cross-platform asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients." For all you droplets that have been following Vapor 3 development, that means NIO will be replacing a significant portion of the code supporting Vapor behind the scenes. To quote [Tanner][https://github.com/tanner0101],

> Swift NIO directly replaces:
> - vapor/async (except we will keep our conveniences here, since they are nicer IMO)
> - vapor/sockets (we only supported TCP, they support TCP, UDP, Unix, way better!)
> - vapor/tls (finally, :pray:)
> - vapor/engine (except websockets and our multipart/form-url stuff. we will also port over our conveniences for header names, body, etc)

Vapor is going to take a performance hit until NIO's HTTP parser can be optimised, but the long term benifits greatly outweigh the short term drawbacks. Having a dedicated team at Apple working on all of the low level code means that the Vapor team is free to make large userfacing improvments using time previously spent mucking around with all the libraries that are being deprecated! 

This raises the question as to weather or not Vapor Nation should cover updates to NIO. What do you think? Drop your opinion in #vapor-nation on Slack or @VaporNationNews on Twitter!

## New Features

### RSA Encription Implemented and Made Available To JWT
```swift
// create public and private key (only public required for verification)
let privateKey: Data = ...
let publicKey: Data = ...
let privateSigner = JWTSigner.rs256(key: .private2048(privateKey))
let publicSigner = JWTSigner.rs256(key: .public2048(publicKey))

// serialize jwt (requires private key)
let payload: TestPayload = ...
var jwt = JWT(payload: payload)
_ = try jwt.sign(using: publicSigner) // throws, can't sign w/ public signer
let data = try jwt.sign(using: privateSigner)

// parse jwt (public and private key work)
let parsed = try JWT<TestPayload>(from: data, verifiedUsing: publicSigner)
let parsed2 = try JWT<TestPayload>(from: data, verifiedUsing: privateSigner) // also works
print(parsed.payload)
print(parsed2.payload)
```
