### `GROUP BY` Added To Database Kit
[@rafiki270](https://github.com/rafiki270) implemented the ability to use the SQL `GROUP BY` clause. `GROUP BY` allows the use of advanced aggregate functions in SQL queries. A simple example would be "I want to know how many users signed up each day for the last month." The query for this might be written this way:

```sql
SELECT
    DATE(signup_date) AS date, COUNT(userId)
FROM Users
WHERE
    signup_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AND NOW()
GROUP BY signup_date
```

Now Fluent can produce a similar result, though there's no higher-level API for using it yet. Stay tuned!

### Fixed Grouping Bug Replacing `AND` with `OR`

### Schema Generation
[@SandorDobi](https://github.com/SandorDobi) added a check for the PostgreSQL server version so Fluent will not attempt to generate `IDENTITY COLUMN`s if the server doesn't support them.

## Tutorials

### How to use Leaf
Martin Lasek is going through and updating all of his Vapor 2 tutorials for Vapor 3, so we should be seeing a lot from him for a few weeks to come! In this tutorial you'll learn how to use Leaf, Vapor's templating language, to create a web page and populate it with data from your server.

### Diving into Vapor, Part 1: Up and Running with Vapor 3
In this tutorial we will cover setting up an environment for building web apps with Swift, creating a Vapor project, examining the structure of a project, and creating a simple route. If you're just now getting started with Vapor, this is a great place to begin!
